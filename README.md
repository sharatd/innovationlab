# Medical Data Sharing 

Our new medical data sharing process cuts time and costs associated with producing 
data use agreements for patients. Researchers can now obtain healthcare data
instantaneously, as opposed to the months-long previous process.

## Summary
Patients fill out a brief questionnaire regarding use cases, data types, and data use 
restrictions for the sharing of medical information. Upon completion, they will sign an
automatically-generated data use agreement based on their answers to the
questionnaire. Researchers will also reap the benefits of this new process. They 
will receive executable code to obtain released patient medical information immediately.

## Problem
Researchers lose valuable time in making potentially life-saving discoveries due to the 
unnecessarily complex and difficult data-sharing processes in place. The current process
involves manually drafting patientsâ€™ data use agreements, filtering through the relevant 
medical information, and parsing the questionnaires again to share info with other researchers.
This time-consuming process is compounded by the fact that it must be repeated when sharing
 medical information between hospitals. 

## Solution
How often have you, as a patient, sat in a waiting room filling out redundant, nearly identical 
data use consent forms? As a researcher, how often have you felt exasperated trying to 
track down medical records and consent forms before conducting research? This automated 
medical data sharing process eliminates the time and financial cost associated with manually 
generating data use agreements and sharing that information with researchers. Furthermore, we will 
create a classification system that can collect data use information from any kind of 
questionnaire regardless of its complexity.
